👋 Hi, I’m @QuotesCosmos, creator of https://www.quotescosmos.com a universal inspirational quotes website.

👀 I’m interested in universal knowledge for everyone. I use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to classify quotes and generate new quotes.

🌱 I’m currently classifying highly-abstract and often ambiguous natural language information. For example, natural language expressions using sarcasm, paradox, and metaphors. These are challenging language examples to train and classify. The fact that language is constantly evolving makes it all the more interesting. But what is life without it's inherent difficulties? 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different ways of sharing universal knowledge with the world. If you're working on a related project, let's talk!
