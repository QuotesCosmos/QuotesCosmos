👋 Hi, I’m @QuotesCosmos, creator of https://www.quotescosmos.com a universal inspirational quotes website.

👀 I’m interested in universal knowledge for everyone. I use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to classify existing quotes and generate new quotes.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to classify highly-abstract and ambiguous natural language information. For example, natural expressions with sarcasm, paradox, and metaphor. These are all quite challenging to train and classify. The fact that language is constantly evolving makes it all the harder. But what is life without it's inherent difficulties, right? 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different ways of sharing universal knowledge with the world. If you're working on a related project, let's talk!
