👋 Hi, I’m @QuotesCosmos, creator of quotescosmos.com a universal inspirational quotes website.

👀 I’m interested in universal knowledge for everyone. I use machine learning and natural language processing to classify existing quotes and generate new quotes.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to classify highly-abstract and ambiguous natural language information. For example, expressions with sarcasm, paradox, and metphor are all difficult to train and classify. The fact that language is constantly evolving makes it all the harder. But what is life without it's inherent challenges, right? 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different ways of sharing universal knowledge with the world.
